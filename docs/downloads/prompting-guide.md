## Core Principles

### 1. Be Clear and Specific

State your task explicitly at the beginning. Provide context. Break complex tasks into steps.

**Weak:**
> Help me with a presentation.

**Strong:**
> I need help creating a 10-slide presentation for our quarterly sales meeting. The presentation should cover Q2 sales performance, top-selling products, and sales targets for Q3. Please provide an outline with key points for each slide.

*Why it works: Specifies deliverable (10 slides), purpose (quarterly meeting), and scope (three topics).*

### 2. Use Examples (But Try Without Them First)

Show the AI what you want rather than just describing it. If you have a specific format or style, provide a sample.

**When examples help most:**
- Niche or specialized formats
- Your personal or organizational style preferences
- Complex structured outputs (tables, reports with specific sections)
- Tasks requiring consistent voice across multiple outputs

**When examples may not be needed:**
- Common formats the AI knows well (standard emails, code patterns)
- When detailed written instructions are clearer than showing
- When you want the AI to suggest the best approach

**Try zero-shot first:** Before adding examples, try the prompt without them. If the output format or style is wrong, tighten instructions or add an output schema. Only add examples if that still fails. When you do use examples, keep them compact — `input → output` pairs work better than verbose multi-paragraph samples.

---

### 3. Encourage Step-by-Step Thinking

For complex tasks, ask the AI to reason through the problem systematically.

**Weak:**
> How can I improve team productivity?

**Strong:**
> I'm looking to improve my team's productivity. Think through this step-by-step:
> 1. Current productivity blockers
> 2. Potential solutions
> 3. Implementation challenges
> 4. Methods to measure improvement
>
> For each step, explain your reasoning briefly. Then summarize your recommendations.

---

### 4. Iterate and Refine

If the first response isn't right, give specific feedback rather than starting over.

**Weak:**
> Make it better.

**Strong:**
> That's a good start. Please refine it:
> 1. Make the tone more casual and friendly
> 2. Add a specific example
> 3. Shorten the second paragraph to focus on benefits rather than features

---

### 5. Assign Roles When Useful

Asking the AI to adopt a perspective can improve relevance and depth.

> You are a senior economics journal referee reviewing a paper for a top journal. Identify the three most critical methodological weaknesses.

Don't use roles for simple tasks. "You are a helpful assistant" adds nothing.

---

### 6. Place Critical Information Strategically

Position your most important instructions at the beginning and end of long prompts.

**Bookend pattern:**
> **[Top]** You must cite sources for all factual claims. Do not speculate.
>
> [... task details, context, documents ...]
>
> **[Final reminder]** Remember: Cite sources for all factual claims. Do not speculate.

---

### 7. Separate Persistent vs Task-Specific Instructions

Treat prompt content as two layers:

- **System prompt (persistent):** Role, tone, safety boundaries, citation rules, house style
- **User prompt (task-specific):** The request, context, and any pasted inputs

```
## System
You are a research assistant. Always cite sources. Never fabricate data.
Tone: professional, concise.

## User
Summarize the following paper, highlighting methodology and key findings:
[paper text here]
```

---

### 8. Request Rationale, Not Chain-of-Thought

When you need transparency, request structured output:

- Ask for **key assumptions** (2-3 bullets)
- Ask for **brief rationale** (2-5 bullets explaining the approach)
- Ask for **checks performed** (what was verified)

**Avoid:** "Show your reasoning step by step" for well-specified tasks. This inflates tokens without improving output.

---

### 9. Calibrate Depth to the Task

Not every task needs the same level of effort. A quick email reply doesn't need the AI to "research best practices."

| Level | When to Use | What to Add |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Light** | Quick tasks, routine emails, simple lookups | Nothing extra — just format clearly |
| **Standard** | Analysis, research writing, design decisions | Ask for assumptions and rationale: *"Include key assumptions (2-3 bullets) and brief rationale for major choices."* |
| **Deep** | High-stakes writing, methodology, pre-analysis plans | Ask for verification: *"Research current best practices. Compare your approach against established standards. Flag where you deviate and why."* |

**Default to Light.** Upgrade when the stakes justify it.

---

### 10. Use XML Tags for Structure

When a prompt has multiple types of content — instructions, background data, documents to analyze — XML-style tags help the AI parse what's what.

```text
<instructions>
Summarize the key findings from this paper. Focus on methodology
and results. Keep it under 300 words.
</instructions>

<paper>
[Full paper text pasted here...]
</paper>

<output_format>
Three sections: (1) Method, (2) Key findings, (3) Limitations.
</output_format>
```

Without tags, the AI has to figure out where your instructions end and the document begins. With tags, there's no ambiguity. You don't need tags for short, simple prompts — they're most useful when mixing instructions with pasted content.

---

### 11. Avoid Common Anti-Patterns

**Vague thoroughness language.** "Be comprehensive" and "be meticulous" are empty calories. Replace with specific verbs:

- "Compare against [specific standard]"
- "Research current best practices for [domain]"
- "Flag where your approach deviates from [benchmark]"

**Over-prompting.** You don't need `CRITICAL: YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY...` — a calm, specific directive works better. Shouting in all-caps doesn't make the AI try harder.

**No pushback permission.** If you want honest feedback, say so: *"Tell me directly if this approach has problems. Don't just agree with everything."*

## Task-Specific Guidance

### Content Creation

Specify audience, tone, and structure:
> Write a blog post about cybersecurity for small business owners. Audience is not tech-savvy. Engaging, slightly humorous tone. Outline for 1000 words covering the top 5 practices.

### Document Summary

Combine specificity with citation requests:
> Summarize this 50-page report in 2 paragraphs focusing on AI trends. Then answer these 3 questions, citing specific sections.

### Data Analysis

Specify format:
> Analyze this data and present as: (1) Executive summary, (2) Key metrics table, (3) Three notable trends, (4) Three data-driven recommendations.

### Brainstorming

Set parameters and request categorization:
> Suggest 10 team-building activities. For each, explain how it fosters teamwork. Categorize by: ice-breakers, communication, problem-solving.

---

## Prompt Chaining

For complex tasks, break the work into a sequence where each step builds on the previous one.

*Prompt 1:* Analyze and identify trends.
*[Review, then...]* *Prompt 2:* Recommend visualizations.
*[Review, then...]* *Prompt 3:* Write executive summary.

**When to use chaining:**
- Multi-step analysis where you want to validate each step
- Creative work where direction might shift
- When "getting it right" matters more than speed

---

## Prompt Versioning

When a prompt is meant to be reused:

- Assign a **version** (e.g., `v1.1`) and a one-line **change note**
- Maintain a small **eval set** (5-15 test cases, including edge cases)
- After edits, re-run against a few cases and note failures

---

## Prompt Structure Template

```
## Role
[Who the AI should be — include only when specialized expertise helps]

## Task
[What you want done — be specific and action-oriented]

## Context
[Background information needed]

## Constraints
[Rules, limitations, scope boundaries, things to avoid]

## Output Format
[How you want the response structured — format, length, style]

## Examples
[Samples of desired style, if applicable]
```

---

## Quick Reference: Quality Checklist

Before sending a complex prompt:

- [ ] Task stated clearly at the beginning
- [ ] Necessary context provided
- [ ] Constraints and scope explicit
- [ ] Desired output format specified
- [ ] Depth calibrated — action-verb directives, not vague adjectives
- [ ] Examples included if format/style matters (tried zero-shot first)
- [ ] Role assigned if specialized expertise helps
- [ ] XML tags used to separate instructions from pasted content (if applicable)
- [ ] Critical instructions repeated at end (bookend pattern for long prompts)
- [ ] No anti-patterns: no vague thoroughness language, no all-caps directives
- [ ] System vs user separation clear (for reusable prompts)

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| AI hallucinates | "If unsure, say so." Ask for citations. Break into smaller steps. |
| Too generic | Add more context. Provide examples. Assign an expert role. |
| Misses requirements | List requirements as numbered items. Use the template. |
| Too long | Specify word count. Ask for bullet points. |
| Too short | Ask to elaborate on specific points. Request reasoning. |
